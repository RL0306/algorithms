## Step 1: Solving things by hand

6
ASHMEADE 9.90 8.85
BLAKE 9.69 8.72
BOLT 9.58 8.43
CARTER 9.78 8.93
FRATER 9.88 8.92
POWELL 9.72 8.61

We solve this by going through each person and finding the minimum that they can have

ASHMEADE:
    Best times from others: Bolt (8.43), Powell (8.61), Blake (8.72)
    Combined score: 9.90 (Ashmeade) + 8.43 (Bolt) + 8.61 (Powell) + 8.72 (Blake) = 35.66
BLAKE:
    Best times from others: Bolt(8.43), Powell ()

Shortest time is 35.54 with Carter, Blake, Powell and Ashmeade
