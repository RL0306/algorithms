## Step 1: Solving things by hand

- **Case 1:**
    - **Input:** 3
        - values = 1 2147483647 2147483647
        - **Answer:** 1

- **Case 2:**
    - **Input:** 5
        - values = 3 4 7 4 3
        - **Answer:** 7

- **Case 3:**
    - **Input:** 5
        - values = 2 10 2 10 5
        - **Answer:** 5


## Step 2: Abstract Formulation

Given a list of integers where each integer can appear at most twice and the total number of integers is odd, find the integer that occurs only once in the list.

## Step 3: Pseudocode solution

```pseudo
numberFrequencies = empty map
for int num : nums
    count = numberFrequencies[num]
    numberFrequencies[num] = count + 1

for key : numberFrequencies
    if key.getValue == 1
        return key.getKey()
unreachable
```

## Step 4: Proof of correctness

If the algorithm returns the entry key value, it indicates that the condition key.getValue == 1 is true, which means the corresponding value only appeared once in the input list. This satisfies the requirement of identifying the unique element from the input list, as stated in our abstract formulation.

Additionally, the algorithm iterates through the entire input list, ensuring that each value is included in the frequency count stored in the map. This guarantees that no input value is overlooked, and all occurrences are properly included during the frequency counting process.

Therefore, by successfully identifying the unique element and considering all input values, our algorithm demonstrates correctness in solving the given problem.
